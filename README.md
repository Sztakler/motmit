# MOT/MIT Experiment

## Experiment description

This experiment comprises of two interweaving parts: Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) and Multiple Item Tracking (MIT). Objects are indefferentiable targets, such as two identical circles. The image below represents a typical sequence of events in a MOT task: target objects are initially highlighted before becoming identical to the distractor. When the objects stop moving few random objects are highlighted again. The challenge is to identify which of them were the targets.

The MIT part differs from MOT in that displayed objects are easily differentiable, e.g. a star and a circle. The participant's task is to determine if highlighted objects were targets and which shapes were highlighted.

## Configuration

In the repo's main catalogue there's a `config.py` file. It serves as a configuration file for the entire experiment.

### Variables' units

- Unit for time variables, such as `cue_time` is a second.
- Unit for size variables, such as `response_circle_radius` **are not pixels**. This program uses normalized units, precisely a percent of the screen's height. The resulting size is calculated as such: `size * scale`, e.g. `0.05 * 1080 = 54px`. More about units: [Psychopy Docs](https://www.psychopy.org/general/units.html#units)
- Colors are generally represented as color strings, e.g. `red` or `blue`. For complete list of available color names look for `colorNames` dictionary in [Psychopy's Color source code](https://www.psychopy.org/_modules/psychopy/colors.html#Color)

### Most important configuration variables

Generally most of the configuration variables **shouldn't be changed**. There are three variables that toogle specific experiment parts -- **these you should change** if need be. E.g. you could disable eyetracker with `eyetracker_on = False` for some quick test or to prevent errors when running the experiment without the connected eyetracker. These variables are:

| Variable Name | Description | Default Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `training_on` | Boolean flag to enable or disable the training phase. | `False` |
| `eyetracker_on` | Boolean flag to enable or disable the eye-tracking system. **It must be enabled in the real experiment**. | `True` |
| `form_on` | Boolean flag to enable or disable the user form (to collect user data before the experiment starts). **It must be enabled in the real experiment**. | `False` |
