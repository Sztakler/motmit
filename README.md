# Eksperyment MOT/MIT

This experiment comprises of two interweaving parts: Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) and Multiple Item Tracking (MIT). Objects are indefferentiable targets, such as two identical circles. The image below represents a typical sequence of events in a MOT task: target objects are initially highlighted before becoming identical to the distractor. When the objects stop moving, the challenge is to identify which objects were the targets.
